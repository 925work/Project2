## How it works

Movie Chats uses an API from themoviedb.org. This API is used to display a selected amount of movies along with their user ratings. 
A user may then click on one of the movies, where they will be led to a chat page to input their review of the movie. 

Through the MySQL database the application calls and stores reviews input by users. Express, axios, fs, and path allow the application to call on the API from themoviedb.org and push the information to the HTML to give us a polished and working application.
